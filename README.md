Title: Quick, effective & efficient way to test your css library on your client.

This article is my way of saying thank you to ushahidi (ushahidi's mentors anna & rowasc were really patient with me as a first time contributor to open source)... restructure this well later.

Article/tutorial steps:

Introduction/appreciation: 
This article is for individuals or organisations who have css (library) hosted separately from the client app. The article is also my way of saying thank you to ushahidi, mentors anna and rowasc for their patience & guidance while contributing to ushahidi for the first time in october 2020 - it was my first ever contribution to open source and to a very large code base for that matter. This was during the outreachy 3-weeks contribution period. I didn't get selected as intern, but the feedback they provided really helped me improve and inspired me to do more - should talk about this in another article I will write on later & link to this article when I'm done.
